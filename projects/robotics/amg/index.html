<h1>EECS 106b: Acoustic Myography (AMG) as a Viable Force Signal</h1>
<h4>Chris Mitchell, Eric Hu, Fayyaz Ahamed</h4>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
<h1>Acoustic Myography Signal Collection</h1>
<p>We performed all of our recordings using the commercially available MyoDynamik CURO (Figure 1), with the large equine AMG sensors depicted. For our recordings, we affixed a sensor to the center of the biceps, with ultrasound gel for noise insulation. Each subject was instructed to sit straight up with their elbow at a 90-degree angle, palms facing up. During the trial, subjects were told to perform isometric (motionless) contractions by pushing up against the bottom of a weighted table, using a subjective fraction of their total strength in increments of 20\% for roughly 2-4 seconds, with 2-4 second rest periods in between contractions (Figure 2). We gathered a total of 25 trials from 8 subjects. All trials for any particular subject were taken back-to-back with a 1-minute rest period, without removing or replacing the sensor.</p>
